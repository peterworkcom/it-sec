# [Web shell upload via race condition](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-race-condition)

> This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Although it performs robust validation on any files that are uploaded, it is possible to bypass this validation entirely by exploiting a race condition in the way it processes them.

> To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.
